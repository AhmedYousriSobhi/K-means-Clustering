# K-means-Clustering
 Implementation of K-means algorithm and use it for image compression. First starting on an example 2D dataset that will help you gain an intuition of how the K-means algorithm works. After that, Using the K-means algorithm for image compression by reducing the number of colors that occur in an image to only those that are most common in that image.
